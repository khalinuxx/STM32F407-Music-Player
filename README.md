# STM32F407 Music Player
This project is a music player that uses an STM32F407 board to read WAV files from a USB drive and output audio through the port jack. The player also includes 5 buttons to control music playback, volume, and track selection.

## Hardware Requirements
To build this project, you will need:
* STM32F407 board
* USB drive
* 5 buttons
* Port jack
* Software Requirements
To program the STM32F407 board, you will need a toolchain that supports ARM Cortex-M processors. We recommend using the STM32CubeIDE, which is a free integrated development environment (IDE) provided by STMicroelectronics.

## Usage
* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Open the project in STM32CubeIDE.
* Build the project and flash it to the STM32F407 board.
* Connect the USB drive to the STM32F407 board.
* Connect the port jack to the audio output of the STM32F407 board.
* Connect the 5 buttons to the GPIO pins of the STM32F407 board.
* Power on the board.
* Use the buttons to control music playback, volume, and track selection.
Configuration
To configure the GPIO pins for button inputs, you can modify the main.c file in the project. The default pin configuration for the buttons is:

* Play/Pause: PA0
* Next Track: PA3
* Previous Track: PA5
* Volume Up: PA1
* Volume Down: PA2
